# Things to note about Pico

- If using Vscode, install VSCODE extension Pico-W-Go v2.1.8 (too bad Vim user)
- You need to make a separate workspace in VSCODE (make a new folder anywhere and then open the folder so that it is the main workspace)
- Once workspace is created, do ctr + shift + p and search for "PICO-W_Go Configure Project" click it
- File that you intend to run on pico must be named main.py
- Check the "all commands" tab at the bottom of the page to see all commands including uploading code to pico
